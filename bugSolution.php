The corrected code addresses the issue by prepending a default scheme (e.g., "http://") to the URL before parsing if a scheme is not already present. This ensures `parse_url()` functions as expected even in the absence of a scheme.  Furthermore, error handling is included to gracefully manage potential issues.
